# Portfolio

This week's project was to build our own Portfolio to showcase our projects and highlight our personal skills. We were also introduced to the importance of web accessibility and how to ensure that your site passes these guidelines.

## My process

It took a lot of my CSS skills to follow this design.
I made the site responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. Testing iPhone 7, 11 and iPad (using Safari) and different desktop screen sizes. I also used google chrome dev tools for the remaining devices. For cross browser testing I tested it on Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge. I also tested the site using a screen reader.
